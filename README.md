# README

First main Rails project from The Odin Project. This project's goal was to work on forms and authentication by allowing to register new users and for these users to create posts visible on the Home page. Only when a person is logged in they can see the author of a post.

User registration and log in is handled by the gem Devise.

Styling was done via the framework Bulma.
